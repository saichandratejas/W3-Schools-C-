- A pointer however, is a variable that stores the memory address as its value.
  
> Ex : 1
  
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string food = "Pizza";  // A string variable
  string* ptr = &food;  // A pointer variable that stores the address of food

  // Output the value of food
  cout << food << "\n";

  // Output the memory address of food
  cout << &food << "\n";

  // Output the memory address of food with the pointer
  cout << ptr << "\n";
  return 0;
}



> Ex : 2 - Modify Pointers

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string food = "Pizza";
  string* ptr = &food;

  // Output the value of food
  cout << food << "\n";

  // Output the memory address of food
  cout << &food << "\n";

  // Access the memory address of food and output its value
  cout << *ptr << "\n";
  
  // Change the value of the pointer
  *ptr = "Hamburger";
  
  // Output the new value of the pointer
  cout << *ptr << "\n";
  
  // Output the new value of the food variable
  cout << food << "\n";
  return 0;
}
